New features are added to the standard by the TC39 committee and each feature goes through several stages before becoming part of the EcmaScript.
So I consider it is unlikely that ill-conceived features with problems in performance will appear.
Also there is big community, greatest developers, which can influence to JS future.
From another side perhaps the developers will use new improvements incorrectly, and then the code permanence will decrease.
