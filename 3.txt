Dead code is code that is never used. It is not referenced by any other code, not used in the final build.
In the Java / С# programming languages, dead code elimination involves the removal of code during the compilation phase. On the other hand, JavaScript is primarily utilized for web development and runs within a browser environment. Dead code elimination in JavaScript is primarily handled by JavaScript engines or JIT compilers.
This is because JavaScript is an interpreted language, and the execution environment can dynamically evaluate the code and identify which parts are unreachable.
JavaScript is dynamically typed, so types can change at runtime. This dynamic nature makes it difficult to determine the types of variables and analyze their usage accurately.
Dead code elimination relies on static analysis to identify unused code, but in JavaScript it becomes more complex because of lack of explicit type information.
It’s also difficult to determine the control flow and identify code that may or may not be executed because of JavaScript asynchronous nature and complex scoping.
